## Purpose

This blog will store ideas, problems, and random musings I have. While I hope an occasional visitor reads my work, I largely view this site as tool for myself. As such, I may go off in wild tangents, or worse, become entirely confusing. If this is the case, please leave a comment and I will get back to you. Iâ€™m always excited to talk about all these things.


## My background

I briefly worked in finance after college and found it just wasn't my thing. Was fortunate to join [42 Silicon Valley](https://www.42.fr/en/) where I grew to love the C language and computer science. I currently work full time as a software engineer at [KCSE](https://www.kcse.com/).
